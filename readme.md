#### To use, clone down or fork. Requires ruby, the latest(stable) version preferred. You **have** to install QT5(https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit)
#### in order for this script to work. After that, run bundle install, then you should be good to go to run 'ruby capycrawl.rb'


####To-Do List
##### Add real error checking for url usability, using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1805761/check-if-url-is-valid-ruby
##### Use spidr (https://github.com/postmodern/spidr) to automate in-depth crawling of a single domain.
##### Create a UI based on a super simple HTML page and perhaps rack to run the script? or just erb it.
